Why should you contribute?
===

Enhance your quality
----------------
All TKO work is subject to rigorous code review by experienced developers and domain specialists. This helps you and your team produce clean and maintainable code.

Qualified users will help you improve and ensure a better functional experience.

Bug reports and fixes reported by the community ensure a stable and reliable solution.

Reduce your costs
----------------
Your developments may no longer be maintained and paid by yourself only!

The maintenance costs of the Apps will be supported by TKO. This includes bugfixes, migrations and functional improvements.

Come by legitimacy and sponsorship
----------------
Anyone working within the same functional area as you will be redirected and asked to collaborate with you.

This will lead to a convergence of work effort rather than divergence, allowing you to rely on your investments.

Acquire funding support
----------------
When the need for extensive development is recognized, beyond the means of one company or customer, TKO can reach out to the community and customers to raise funds and validate requirements.

This allows creation, modification and extensions of high quality Apps with wide appeal where financial risk is spread across many potential beneficiaries.
